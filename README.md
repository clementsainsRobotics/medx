at the beginning i thought to build a java+sql database frontend to simply move some data inside the hospital
medics database of counter cancer institute "nii onkologii", i was working on it with Alexei Novik
that was a hard time when i've met Alex in institute and he has a database working on msaccess, 
so i gotta ask him first if he wants to share database structure.  
first i was trying to modify it with my other friend but he left saying that it is very hard for him building a visual basic database
ok then i've moved to csharp, since "they said" and began to rebuild msaccess structure for sql environment
and after doing that wrote some part of gui that is stil not ended because 
after some time the others "they said" we got to work with licensed database only
well it's alright since this data is more than just private.
so there will be no any data here and 
actually i was doing this thinking crossplatforming way and it was more mono2 compatible
and it was built on postgersql with npgsql plugin

SyncToolBase - is for syncing tables of different databases running as service with timer - very easy scriptalike
